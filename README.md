Massive growth in the digital economy due to ecommerce. The Vietnamese market is also expected to quadruple to 39 billion USD by 2025 from 13 billion USD last year. Suitable for future development.

Vietnam's economic growth slowed down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but in 2021, the digital economy in general and e-commerce in particular was a bright spot. According to a report by Google, Temasek and Bain&Company, the total merchandise value (GMV) of the e-commerce industry in Vietnam grew dramatically from 8 billion USD in 2020 to 13 billion USD in 2021.
